      <h3 class="dev-section-heading heading-medium">SmartMesh™ and the Eterna® SoC</h3>

      <p>A SmartMesh™ network consists of a self-forming multi-hop mesh of nodes, known as motes, which collect and relay data, and a network manager that monitors and manages network performance and security, and exchanges data with a host application. SmartMesh motes and managers are complete wireless sensor network solutions, enabling OEMs to focus on application solutions and not wireless R&D. They combine a time-synchronized, channel hopping link layer with hardware based on Dust Networks Eterna® system-on-chip technology for a complete wireless networking solution with:</p>

      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>>99.999% Data Reliability in the most challenging RF environments</li>
        <li>>10 Year Battery Life for Every Node in the Network, including routing nodes</li>
        <li>Complete Wireless Mesh Solution so no network stack development is required</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Dust Networks pioneered time-synchronized, channel-hopping multi-hop mesh networking and has been at the forefront of WSN standards efforts, including international standard IEC62591 (WirelessHART), and emerging Internet Protocol standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4e and the IETF’s 6TSCH.</p>

      <p>Dust Networks is a part of Linear Technology Corporation, a member of the S&P 500, that has been designing, manufacturing and marketing a broad line of high performance analog integrated circuits for major companies worldwide for three decades. The Company’s products provide an essential bridge between our analog world and the digital electronics in communications, networking, industrial, automotive, computer, medical, instrumentation, consumer, and military and aerospace systems. Linear Technology produces power management, data conversion, signal conditioning, RF and interface ICs, µModule® subsystems, and wireless sensor network products.</p>
