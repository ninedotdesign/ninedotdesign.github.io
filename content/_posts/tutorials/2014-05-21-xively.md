![How it works]({% asset_path tutorials/xively/whatsxively-howitworks.jpg %})


XivelyÂ simplifies the interconnection of devices, data, people and places, accelerating the creation of compelling solutions that transform how people experience their world.

The Xively Developer Workbench enables you to prototype interactive connected products quickly and easily. 

There are three stages in the Xively development process:

1. **Develop** connected experiences quickly and easily to get your devices, apps and services working together through Xively.
2. **Deploy** turns prototypes into products at the push of a button.
3. **Manage** batches of products no matter the size, one or one million, and support your devices in real time.
