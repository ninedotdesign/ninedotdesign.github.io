#Introduction

This guide introduces you to the very basics of using the Xively API.

This guide assumes you have:
- signed up to Xively
- obtained an API key
- installed [_cURL_](http://curl.haxx.se/) (comes with Mac OS X and most Linux and BSD distributions).
- a familiarity with running UNIX shell (Terminal) commands

#Create a Feed

First let's create an empty feed template.
We'll just give it a `title` and `version` for now and specify the rest later.

You will need to `POST` a simple JSON object to `/v2/feeds` like so:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xively-gists/2b8dc1591145970b185c.js?file=create_feed_minimal_curl.sh"></script>

In the response you should see a status code of 201 (Created) and a `Location` header containing the URL of the newly created feed.
We'll use this URL in the next steps of this tutorial.

<!-- /Section end -->

<div id="update" class="tutorial-section">  
{% capture section %}
<!-- /Section beginning -->

#Update your feed

Now let's update your feed and its datastreams. We'll set up three datastreams with unique names.
For this you need to `PUT` the payload to the new URL of the Feed you just obtained.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xively-gists/2b8dc1591145970b185c.js?file=update_feed_payload.json"></script>

Let's save this to a file called `feed_update_payload.json` and run _cURL_ with the arguments as shown:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xively-gists/2b8dc1591145970b185c.js?file=update_feed_curl.sh"></script>

We can now update the values by editing the JSON file and repeat this request whenever required.

#Retrieve your Feed

Let's take a look at the current state of our feed.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xively-gists/2b8dc1591145970b185c.js?file=retrieve_feed_curl.sh"></script>

Now weâ€™ll see the current values coming from our feed and its datastreams, similar to this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/xively-gists/2b8dc1591145970b185c.js?file=retrieve_feed_response.json"></script>

<!-- /Section end -->
