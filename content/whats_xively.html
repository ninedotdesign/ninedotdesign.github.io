        <li>
          <h4>Open Platform with Unlimited Choice</h4>
          <p>Xively supports many software and hardware combinations needed to create your products and solutions, with <a href="/dev/libraries/">official libraries</a> for dozens of languages and platforms, including Objective C, C, Java, JavaScript, Ruby and much more. Our restful API supports <a href="/dev/docs/api/communicating/data_formats/">JSON, XML &amp; CSV data formats</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Secure Experiences</h4>
          <p>Xively offers end-to-end security across the entire platform to ensure product/solution integrity. Secure provisioning ensures tight control over devices, industry standard symmetric data encryption (TLS, SSL) protects communications channels, fine-grained permissioning (API keys) gives the right access at the right time to the right person, and Xively’s private cloud infrastructure ensures that your data is safe at all times.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Simple, Frictionless Developer Experience</h4>
          <p>Intuitive, web-based tools simplify the complexities of IoT development. The Xively Developer Workbench offers interactive connected product development and sophisticated debugging tools including real-time HTTP message monitoring, an API request-builder, usage tracking and visualization.</p>
          <p>The Xively Developer Center cuts your development time and accelerates your learning curve through documentation, tutorials, videos and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Selective Data Sharing</h4>
          <p>Selectively and securely share device data or control with other applications or devices on your terms. Once published, your connected product becomes part of the Connected Object Cloud&trade;.</p>
          <p>Through Xively’s granular and secure sharing features, you can selectively interconnect your products with third-party devices, applications and services into an exponentially capable solution. Share your data with the world or lock your product into a closed loop system – it's your choice.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Global IoT Cloud Infrastructure</h4>
          <p>Our global cloud, built on the LogMeIn Gravity data service, is monitored through a 24x7x365 Network Operations Center. LogMeIn and Xively currently support over 200 million devices for 17 million users.</p>
