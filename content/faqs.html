          <h3 class="heading-smallest">What is the Internet of Things? And what part does Xively play?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The Internet of Things has dozens of definitions, but they generally all talk about using the Internet (which people are accustomed to using for email, social networking, web browsing and e-commerce) as the backbone for communication by sensors, actuators, devices, buildings, streets, machines and smart cities. Xively is a massively scalable infrastructure for handling and managing data generated by these things as well as teams that are building them, but it’s also a lot more: we’ve been around since the industry began and we’ve watched it mature into both a cultural and commercial phenomenon. This gives us unique insight into what people, teams and companies require in order to experiment, innovate and commercialize the quickest, and we take pride in providing a strong thought leadership and standardizing role in the industry as a whole.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Xively charges by the channel through a commercial service offering. On average, a typical connected device has somewhere between 3 and 5 channels, but you can have as few or as many as you want. You buy the channels you need for each device based on the transaction level of the device (low, medium, high). Channel pricing is determined by the level of commercial service you have (Starter, Value or Select). All the details are outlined on the <a href="/pricing/">pricing page</a>.</p>

          <p>Xively is a serious cloud infrastructure with customers relying on us to provide a secure, rock-solid and reliable service to power critical business operations.

          <h3 class="heading-smallest">How do I purchase the commercial service?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Xively offers three tiers of commercial service (Starter, Value, Scale), each based on an annual platform license that maps to the number and type of devices you intend to build. Each annual platform license allows customers the right to purchase and consume as many channels as they want for each transaction type (low, medium, high) at a specific price. Customers go through a simple four-step process to determine what service level is best for their business.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Profile what type of device or devices you are going to build (for each device, determine if the devices require a low, medium or high transaction volume).</li>
            <li>Decide how many devices of each profile you are going to build.</li>
            <li>Based on the number of channels per device and the type of device you are going to build, calculate the total number of each type of channel (low, medium, high) you will need.</li>
            <li>Choose a level of commercial service (starter, value, scale) that best fits the number of devices you intend to build and your business requirements.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A channel is a specific data attribute (i.e. temperature, on/off, waypoint) of a device connected to Xively. It is a single stream of data, which can contain one type of value. It will store all historic (timestamped) entries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
