The product management portion of the Xively API provides you with the ability to [define and manage product batches](products/) and to [provision](provisioning/), [activate](devices/activate_device/) and [manage individual devices](devices/) within a batch. All of the capabilities available within the API with the exception of device activation can also be accessed from within the Xively Management Console.

**Notes**
- You must use your [master key](/dev/docs/api/security/keys/) in order to use product and/or device APIs.
