There are currently two active versions of the Xively API:

**Version 2**, base URL: https://api.xively.com/**v2**/* 
<br>_(released Aug 2010 - current, supported)_

**Version 1**, base URL: https://api.xively.com/**v1**/*
<br>_(released Feb 2008 - deprecated, unsupported)_

For legacy compatibility, the v1 API will also remain available at http://www.xively.com/api/* 

For all new development, you should you should use Version 2 of the Xively API.

As we make updates and additions to the Xively API, we will only make changes, add new features and/or implement fixes to the current released API that do not affect backward compatibility.

JSON and XML formats both have version numbers included as part of their structure. This enables you either to specify a particular format for consistency or to verify what format the document you are working with is represented in.
