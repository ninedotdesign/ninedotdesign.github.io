The Xively API supports both [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https/) and [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http/) communications.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is method for establishing secure communications on the Internet. HTTPS is created when Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is layered on top of the SSL/TLS protocol to provide authentication of the endpoint with which one is communicating as well as bidirectional communications encryption. This protects HTTPS communications from man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping and tampering.

While Xively supports HTTP, this method of communications is **not** recommended. We **strongly** recommend that all interactions with Xively be over HTTPS.
