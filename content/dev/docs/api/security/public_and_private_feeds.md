For detailed information, visit the Creative Commons website, [http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), but briefly this means that all data about and created by a public device can be copied, shared and modified by anyone, even for commercial gain.
