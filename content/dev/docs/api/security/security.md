Industry-standard [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https/) secure access is the default communications protocol that should be used for all API communications with Xively.

All of Xively's Web tools including the Developer Workbench and the Management Console communicate using HTTPS.

See more details on using HTTPS and Sockets to [communicate with Xively](/dev/docs/api/communicating/).
