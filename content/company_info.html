			<h2 class="heading-medium">History</h2>
			<p>Pachube launched in London in 2008, one of the first Internet of Things open platforms and quickly gave rise to one of the most vibrant and creative community of IoT enthusiasts, early adopters and developers in the world. 2010 saw Pachube providing backend infrastructure for Cisco’s Urban EcoMap and empowering consumer products like the Current Cost internet-connected energy monitor.</p>

			<h2 class="heading-small">Milestones</h2>
			<p>In 2011, following the nuclear disaster in Japan, Pachube was a key online data store for thousands of real-time radiation feeds generated by community members around the planet concerned about the lack of official information.					</p>
			<p>LogMeIn Inc acquired Pachube in 2011 in order to expand its specialty in making remote device access and control quick and easy. The team grew, the platform evolved and a new beta iteration, Cosm, was released in 2012, going on to underpin the infrastructure behind a number of early IoT Kickstarter products, including the community-initiated project, Air Quality Egg.</p>
